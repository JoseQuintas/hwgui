1. Preface
----------

MacOS by Apple is not official supported by the Harbour project,
but the "xcode" development environment allows
to run Harbour and HWGUI applications on MacOS.
An extra set of make scripts are added to HWGUI, 
because a selection macro for the OS like "{linux}"
can not be set in *.hbp files for hbmk2 utility.

Some little modification in the HWGUI source code is done.

The MacOS kernel is derived from BSD, so LINUX scripts
and commands are running also here.


2. Installation steps
---------------------

Installation instructions, tested under 
MacOS Sonoma 14.5
Dual-Core Intel i3, 1.1GHz

For editing text files you need a suitable text editor,
the "TextEdit" coming with the system is only for some formats
(Rich-Text, HTML, ...)
For more info see chapter "2. Hints for programmers". 

    1.) Launch terminal:
        must be found in Applications/Utilities, 
        search for "Terminal":
        Finder, menu item "Go" (Gehe zu) and
        "Utilities" (Dienstprogramme), 
        key "command" + "U" 
        Start the Terminal and
        fix the Terminal at the dock, if running.
        (german: "Im Dock behalten")


    2.) Install the "xcode" development environment:
        xcode-select --install
        When extra window appeared, press the "Install" button
        in this extra window.
        Check the compiler by entering:
        gcc --version


    3.) Install Harbour from Source:
        - Download the newest code snapshot as ZIP 
        - Extract the Harbour archive,
          most done automatically.
        - become root user by
          sudo su 
          ==> Enter your password.
        - cd into base directory of Harbour
        - export HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
        - make install
        - leave root modus with "exit"
        - check:
          hbmk2 --version

       Path info:
       - All binaries are reachable by system PATH (/usr/local/bin)
       - Library path: /usr/local/lib/harbour
       - Include path: /usr/local/include/harbour


    4.) Install macports:

 
       Download package file for your OS, for example:
       MacPorts-2.9.3-14-Sonoma.pkg

      - become root with
        sudo su
      - installer -target / -pkg MacPorts-2.9.3-14-Sonoma.pkg
      - leave root by "exit"


  
    5.) Install GTK2    
    
       - sudo /opt/local/bin/port install gtk2

         Answer question "Continue? [Y/n]:" with "y"
         (after display of all dependency packages to be installed)
 
   
    6.) Install pkgconfig

        - sudo /opt/local/bin/port install pkgconfig   
   
        - Test flag display for GTK2:
         /opt/local/bin/pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0


    7.) Install XQuartz

        GTK2 supports only X11, so you need to install and
        start an X11 server:
        Download XQuartz from [6]
        for example XQuartz-2.8.5.pkg
        install by typing:
        sudo installer -target / -pkg XQuartz-2.8.5.pkg

        There must be started a background process.
        Test: 
        start "xeyes" or "xclock" in the terminal.
        Be shure, that the X icon is visible in the dock
        (after every login). A running process is marked
        with little point under the icon.
        Adding a "&" after the program call command,
        the program starts in background and you can enter
        more commands.
  

    7.) Compile HWGUI

        Installation destination is
        /Users/<userid>/hwgui/hwgui
        (at your home diectory)
     
        - Create directory:
          mkdir hwgui
          and extract archive here.
        - rename hwgui-code-rnnnn... only to "hwgui"
        - set execute permission by
          chmod 755 make_macgtk2.sh
        - Start compilation by calling
          ./make_macgtk2.sh

  
    8.) Compile a sample program
     
        goto directory "samples"
        and start compiling of arraybrowse.prg
        hbmk2 arraybrowse_mac.hbp
        Ignore warning:
        ld: warning: ignoring duplicate libraries: '-lhbrdd', '-lhbrtl', '-lhbvm'

        Start sample programm:
        ./arraybrowse
 

    9.) Compile your own application

        Use the file arraybrowse_mac.hbp as a template
        to create a hbp file for building your own application.
  

2. Hints for programmers
------------------------

- Looking for a good editor to edit program code:
   Ask your preferred search engine entering: 
   "macos good text editor for programmers"  
   and you will get a lot of suggestions.
   I prefer "CotEditor", it is like "Notepad++"
   on Windows [4] and Open Source.
   But for Clipper/Harbour there is no syntax file
   available [5].
   
- Expand PATH
  Many of the new products are installed in another path.
  You can extend the path of the system as follows:
  - sudo bash 
    vim /etc/paths
  - Insert line at the end:
    /opt/local/bin
    To do this, turn on the append mode with "A",
    and press <ENTER> for a new line.
    After entering the new line 
    exit insert mode with the <ESC> key  
    and save by  
    wq!
  - Exit "root" mode with
    exit
  - Restart the computer for the change to take effect. 
 
- Installing the Subversion command line client
   sudo /opt/local/bin/port install subversion
   Actions analogous to "7.) Install XQuartz",
   but afterwards the "dbus-daemon" can 
   be deactivated, because it is not needed.
   Do this in "System settings" (Systemeinstellungen),
   "Common" (Allgemein), "Login items" (Anmeldeobjekte)
   Set 3 switches to "off".
   Check with
   svn --version
    whether the client starts.
    

- malloc.h is deprecated. 
  Now stdlib.h must be used instead
  (is not more part of ISO C99 standard).
 
  Inserted in  
   ==> source\gtk\inter.c
   ==> source\gtk\misc.c

  It depends of the Version of GCC,
  so set compiler switch -d__NOMALLOCH__,
  if needed.  
   
  #ifdef __NOMALLOCH__
  #include <stdlib.h>
  #else
  #include <malloc.h>
  #endif   

- This compiler define selects automatically code for MacOS
  #ifdef __APPLE__
   
- MacOS has no file like windows.h, so 
  windows_mac.h must be included instead.

  #ifdef __APPLE__
  #include "windows_mac.h"
  #else
  #include <windows.h>
  #endif  
 
  also for io.h: 
  #ifdef __APPLE__
          #include <sys/uio.h>
          #include <unistd.h>
  #else
          #include <io.h>
  #endif
