       msrec --> aArray
    so you need to make search and replace in your programs to rename them.

    New classes are added - HRepItem,HRepTmpl, which provides printing
    using the reports, created with the Designer.

[+] OpenImage( cFileName,lString ) function has been added - it reads some
      picture files ( jpeg, gif ) and converts them to the HBitmap structure,
      so the HBitmap():AddFile( cFileName ) can load now jpeg and gif files,
      @ x,y BITMAP command now works with jpeg and gif, too.

[*] Important HPrinter enhancements:
    - New parameter added to the HPrinter():New() method - lmm - if it is TRUE,
      all subsequent printer operations accept coordinates as millimeters ;
    - New commands has been added:
       INIT PRINTER <oPrinter> [ NAME <cPrinter> ] [ <lPixel: PIXEL> ]
       INIT DEFAULT PRINTER <oPrinter> [ <lPixel: PIXEL> ]
      By default ( if the PIXEL clause isn't used, all subsequent printer
      operations accept coordinates as millimeters ;
    - New method for HPrinter has been implemented - SetMode( nOrientation )
      to change the orientation:
         portrait(nOrientation==1) / landscape(nOrientation==2) ;

    functions calls onEvent() method instead of appropriate Def* function.
    This allow to subclass window, dialog and control classes and, defining new
    onEvent() methods for them, to change the default messages processing.
    The HWindow() class is now a parent class for HMainWindow(), HMDIChildWindow()
    and HChildWIndow() classes.
