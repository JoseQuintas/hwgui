1. Introduction
_______________

The main goal of this project is testing of a class HCEdiExt,
which is intended to be used for an embedded rich text editor in applications,
written on Harbour + HwGUI.

I need an editor with a limited set of features,
which are really needed to create a well-formatted content,
an editor without excess stuff, redundant possibilities,
which are rarely used, but makes the application large and slow.
Besides, I want the file format was similar to html to make it
easy to view and edit it in any plain text editor and to convert
it to html. And, finally, I want to have few special features,
such as embedded calculator, access control to certain parts of the document,
which I find useful and plan to use in my applications.

Read more information in file "editor.hwge", open it with the editor in the
"File / Open" menu.
