 No support possible at this time.

Prerequisites
=============

You need GNU make, install it in c:\make.
The binary "make.exe" must be found in subdir "bin".
The make utility make does not understand GNU make syntax,
so this appears at the beginning in the value of PATH.

(only need for a "portable" installation from archive "dm857c.zip")

Install it in c:\dm (create directory by hand).
