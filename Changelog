  * source\hbrowse.prg
    * Added method SetRowHeight to force (and retrieve) row height in pixels
	  (also at runtime)
    * Now footer is docked at the bottom of the browse client-area
	* Since you can set a font for the header, you have to use this font
	  for header height calculation,column dragging, clicking etc
	* If you change header font at run-time you have to call ::Refresh
	  example: 
        oBrw1:oHeadFont := HFont():Add( 'Times New Roman',0,-12,400,,,)
        oBrw1:Refresh()

  * source\hedit.prg
    * Changed STATIC PROCEDURES __Valid() and __When() to methods.
      This necessitated converting almost all STATIC PROCEDURES to
      methods - imo a good thing. I made the new methods PROTECTED.
      Spelling of Lenght changed to Length throughout.
  * source\hwindow.prg
    + Added data fields lBmpCenter and nBmpClr. These allow the bitmap
      to be centered (as opposed to tiled) and to have the colour match
      the bitmap.
  * source\draw.c
    + Added CenterBitmap( hDC, hWnd, hBitmap, style, brush ) to support
      change above.
  * source\hbrowse.prg
    + Added oHeadFont variable to HBrowse class. If it is set it
      is used in preference to the Browse font for the header.
  * source\menu_c.c
    * Added code in HWG__ADDMENUITEM() to set the ID of submenus, the MS API
      seems to assume that you wouldn't really want to, but if you are used
      to getting help via IDs for popups in 16bit, then this will help you.

      hShape draws a rectangular or curve shape with custom colors,
      brushes, borders, etc.
      @ <x>, <y> SHAPE [<oShape>] [OF <oWnd>] ;
        [ ID <nId> ]               ;

          A MUST HAVE if you have right aligned columns next to left
          aligned ones... (bug tracker #0003)
        * Added SeparatorOut method (called internally). The separator lines
          are now drawn by this method. Till now this job was a "side-effect"
          of HeaderOut
        * For the above reason, the mouse pointer changed in the "resize"
          picture also when no header row was available. Set lDispHead to .F.
          and the pointer will not change (bug tracker #0015)

2008-07-05 18:55 UTC+0100 Maurizio la Cecilia <m.lacecilia@gmail.com>

  * source\hcontrol.prg
    * deleted the unuseful ::nameAssign method and moved his code to
      the assign name code
  * source\hownbtn.prg
    * removed duplicated block of code
  * source\htimer.prg
    * Issue 0016 of bug tracker solved (by Luis Fernando Basso
      submission)
      added the name property to allow same behaviour of other controls
    + added the ::interval assigned property, allowing to change the
      timing value or, assigning a 0 value, killing the timer itself
      use simply with:

    * corrected the AddEvent() call parameter to comply with newID()
      behaviour

2008-07-02 13:50 UTC+0100 Giuseppe Mastrangelo  <giuseppe-mastrangelo@tiscali.it>
  * source/hbrowse.prg
    ! Fixed the position of scrollbar when in the init the record
        is not the first.

2008-07-01 15:15 UTC+0100 Maurizio la Cecilia <m.lacecilia@gmail.com>
  * include\windows.ch
    + added defines for hStatus control
  * source\guimain.prg
    + added the ReadStatus() function with syntax:
      cText := ReadStatus( oWnd, nPart)
      returning the text contained in the nPart (1 based)
      of oWnd status bar, Null string is returned if no status bar
      is present

2008-07-01 20:45 UTC+0100 Giuseppe Mastrangelo  <giuseppe-mastrangelo@tiscali.it>
  * source/hdialog.prg

      behaviour
  * source\hfrmtmpl.prg
  * utils\designer\hformgen.prg
    + added the oParent property to the respective objects to comply
      with newID() behaviour

2008-07-01 01:15 UTC+0100 Maurizio la Cecilia <m.lacecilia@gmail.com>
  * source\hcwindow.prg
    * now is possible to pass the control ID to AddEvent() in place of
      the control itself

2008-06-28 17:15 UTC+0100 Maurizio la Cecilia <m.lacecilia@gmail.com>
  * source\hcwindow.prg
    * enhanced the AddEvent method and moved from inline to separate
      function
    * changed the FindControl method to recursively search also in all
      controls acting as containers.
      BE AWARE: this new behaviour is working fine if none duplicated
      ID exists in the same form. this is assured by the new way the
      hControl:newID() generates automatically the ID number, but
      could generate errors if the ID are manually assigned and some
      duplicate ID number exists not only in the same parent but also
      in all the form controls
  * source\hcontrol.prg
    * changed the new ID assignment to assure no duplicates into the
      same form also if have controls acting as containers
    * enhancement in management of the cursor keys presses
  * source\misc.c
    + added the GetClipboardText() function

2008-06-28 17:15 UTC+0100 Maurizio la Cecilia <m.lacecilia@gmail.com>

  * source\hriched.prg
  * source\htool.prg
  * source\hupdown.prg
    + added named methods for events in controls, after a request of
      Luis Fernando Basso.
      Each event added to the messages processed list have now a method
      referenced in its class, inserted automatically at create time.
      The methods have standard names, most easily comprehensible, as:
      onClick, onChange, onGotFocus, onLostFocus.
      Thus, now is possible to execute code as:
      oDlg:oButSave:onClick()
      or
      oDlg:oTabStock:oAmount:onLostFocus()
      A deeper test could show some side effect, then you are invited to
      signal any side effect or error.
  * samples\tstAnimation.prg
    * enhanced code and form behaviour
  + samples\tstAnimation.rc
    + added the demo resource file previously omitted

2008-06-28 15:15 UTC+0100 Giuseppe Mastrangelo  <giuseppe-mastrangelo@tiscali.it>
  * source/hcontrol.prg
    ! In buttonex activated keys up, down, left and right to navigate
        in controls with WS_TABSTOP.

2008-06-27 13:35 UTC+0100 Maurizio la Cecilia <m.lacecilia@gmail.com>
  * source\hcheck.prg
  * source\hcombo.prg
  * source\hupdown.prg
    * updated the __when function to obey to navigation on the form
      (better would be to add a method in hcontrol, but this will make in
       a subsequent code rearranging)
  * source\misc.c
    + added some parameters to keyb_event function allowing to combine key
      press also with ctrl and alt keys. The new syntax is:
      keyb_event( nKeyCode, lIsExtCode, lShiftPress, lCtrlPress, lAltPress)

2008-06-26 19:30 UTC+0100 Maurizio la Cecilia <m.lacecilia@gmail.com>
  * source/hedit.prg
    - purged the unneeded nSkip property
    * corrected the management of the End keypress
    * corrected the nSkip assignment for Tab keypress
    * avoided negative index using ATail function for better compatibility
  * source/hcontrol.prg
    + added the name property allowing to generate a custom named property for
      each control in his parent. From an initial idea of Luis Fernando Basso,
      this could be very useful for referencing objects by name, even for
      constructing  and reusing standardized controls also in designer.
      Once defined oCtrl:name = "CustomName", where CustomName is really any
      name observing the naming conventions, you now can access the control by
      name or in his class hierarchy using i.e.:
      oDlg:CustomName[:<prop/meth>] or
      oForm:oTabStocks:AnyCustomName[:<prop/meth>]
    - striped out large remmed source code
  * utils/designer/extmodul.ch
    + added HWG_SETWINDOWSTYLE, HWG_SETWINDOWEXSTYLE, HWG_GETWINDOWSTYLE,

    ! Fixed lColorinFocus in some case the color background isn't restored.

2008-06-24 21:30 UTC+0100 Giuseppe Mastrangelo  <giuseppe-mastrangelo@tiscali.it>
  * source/hbrowse.prg
    ! If eof enter in edit mode only if lAppMode=.T. .

      incompatibility with some compiler
  * include\windows.ch
    * moved here the constants for hAnimation class
  + samples\bldhrb.bat
    + batch file from Viktor Szakàts for samples Harbour build
  * all the files below are changed to obtain 2 things:
    . compile without warnings in both Harbour and xHarbour with
      /W2 /ES2 flags. I've tested many samples compiled in Harbour
      and now all seems working fine, but you're invited to make
      same thing and to signal or correct some mismatch.
      Thanks to Viktor Szakàts for his precious suggestions and
      very effective and gentle collaboration in restoring Harbour
      HwGUI compatibility.
    . prepare the code for a deeper revisitation, hoping to release
      a new stable version. I know ther'is a lot of HB_SYMBOL_UNUSED

2008-05-15 17:10 UTC+0100 Maurizio la Cecilia <m.lacecilia@gmail.com>
   * source/hbrowse.prg
         * forced the hbrowse to gain the focus when scrolled (if edit is
           pending, the edit control position was unchanged and the scoll
           was inconsistent, this was happening when the parent dialog hbrowse
           is nomodal, as in the designer)
           better would be to reassign the focus to the edit control if
           even visible after the scroll, but not tried to do this at this
           commit

      pass to the parent window the management of the changed state of
      the button.
