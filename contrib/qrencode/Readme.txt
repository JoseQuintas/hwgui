The version in the "Files" section is tested with HWGUI.
Optional get recent version from:

The QR code was returned as pure text and 
it is converted to a bitmap with extra HWGUI functions.
See format description in 
hwgdoc_functions.html, "QR code functions" ==> "Format description".


Now the modified code for non C99 standard support compiler also 
found in the HWGUI repository.
So no DLL is needed and the feature can be now statically linked
into a HWGUI program.
Compile all needed components to integrate the QR encoding feature
in  a few steps. 


2.) Installation instructions.

2.1) Supported compiler

At this time only the following compiler are supported:
- MinGW32
- MinGW64 (also with Msys2 environment)
- GTK/LINUX and MacOS with gcc
- Borland C, Watcom C and Pelles C under construction. 
- Borland C with DLL, see extra instructions
  (may be run with other Windows C compiler)


Build scripts for other compilers are delivered 
as soon as possible.

 
2.2) Steps to install QR-Code-generator
 
- On Windows, start path script concerning the used compiler,
  for example:
  pfad.bat
 
- make command reachable ?
  make --version
  GNU Make 3.81
  Copyright (C) 2006  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.
  There is NO warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  If not, see HWGUI installation instruction for Windows.
  
- Compile Harbour and HWGUI with the desired compiler.  


2.3) Steps to build all programs and libraries

     - Change to HWGUI directory "contrib/qrencode"
     - build.bat or LINUX/MacOS: ./build.sh
     - Check, that all libraries for the HWGUI interface module
       are present, they are created in the HWGUI "lib" directory:
       "libqrcodegen.<ext>"
       "libhbqrencode.<ext>"

       <ext>: a, or lib or ? (depends of the used compiler)

2.4) Test with sample program
   
     cd samples
     hbmk2 qrencode.hbp
     qrencode.exe or ./qrencode
     Press button "Test":
     At first, the size of the QR code image is displayed, press "OK".
     Read the generated QR code with the smart (mobile) phone,
     the HWGUI project site must be opened.
     Quit by "OK", if ready.
     A second run with another QR code follows.

    

2.5) Final instructions

Be shure, that the following options are inserted in 
the *.hbp file or Makefile of your application:

-L../lib

-lqrcodegen
-lhbqrencode

Copy also the generated libraries and the header file
to reach the path's by compile or running task.


2.6) Extra instructions for non C99 standard compiler

    In this case, the library "contrib\qrencode\qrencode.c"
    cannot be compiled with the compiler not supporting
    the C99 standard.
    Instead the use of a DLL (qrcodegen.dll) is the
    only way to get a running QR code generator.
    The ready to use DLL (compiled with MinGW32)
    can be downloaded from the files section of
    the HWGUI project site a sourceforge.net.

    The sample program "qrencodedll.prg"
    demonstrates the usage of the DLL.
    
2.6.1) Borland C

   If the port of "qrcodegenerator.c" is done,
   you can compile it also with Borland C.
   
   Nevertheless if you want to use an external DLL,
   follow these instructions:   

   - Download the DLL (location see above)
   - Set environment for Borland C, for example:
      C:\hwgui\hwgui-bcc\samples\dev\env\pfad_bc.bat 
   - Compile the sample qrencodedll.prg:
      hbmk2 qrencodedll.hbp
   - Copy the DLL into the sample directory	  
     and run the sample program.
   - Copy the DLL into the directory running your HWGUI application.   

   
3.) Generate QR code by bat oder sh calls

  The file libqrcode_hb.prg is a collection of HWGUI
  functions needed to make the QR encode feature available
  for Harbour console programs.

  The (sample) program hb_qrencode.prg is a full application to
  generate QR codes from command line.


   Scripts build.bat or build.sh builds now also the sample program.

   Now start the console program
  
   Synopsis:
   
   hb_qrencode <text convert to QR code> , <bitmap file name with QRcode,
     add extension ".bmp"> [,<zoom factor>]

   Default value for zoom factor is 3
 
   Sample calls:
   hb_qrencode "https://sourceforge.net/projects/hwgui" hwgui_sf.bmp
   hb_qrencode "https://www.darc.de" darc.bmp
   
   For LINUX and MacOS say ./hb_qrencode !
 
   Trouble with Euro currency sign:
   (Windows only)
   * Euro = 3f (63 dec) = ?
   ==> Instead of the Euro sign a "?" appears.
   It seems, that is a problem by passing the character â‚¬
   on the command line interface.
   The Euro sign is passed and visible, but not passed to the program.
   See image:
   command_with_Euro.png
   (in subdirectory "img")
   On LINUX, no trouble to write any UTF-8 into the QR code.


4.) File list

5.) Further instructions

===================================================================
Important !
Now the QR-Code-Generator is now part of the HWGUI contrib source.
Need not to extract it from the original archive, because it is
modified for all compilers supporting HWGUI.
But if a new release is published, feel free to compile it with
a C99 standard compiler. 

 Extract the archive "QR-Code-generator-master.zip" in an temporary directory.

-  Change to build directory:
    cd QR-Code-generator-master
    cd c
  
- All Windows platforms:
   Copy the desired build script from HWGUI environment
   in directory "contrib\qrencode" into the temporary directory
   above.
   For example: Makefile.mingw

- Start build process:
  
   MinGW: make -f Makefile.mingw *)
   LINUX: make (usage of the Makefile delivered by archive of QR code generator)
  
   *) Build script only builds  the library and the demo program in C, but not the
    sample and demo program of HWGUI.  

- Copy header file "qrcodegen.h" to contrib\qrencode\include 
  
- copy library "libqrcodegen.a" or "libqrcodegen.lib"
   to the HWGUI "lib" directory.
 

   The file extension depends of the used compiler.

- Optional: the temporary build directory is not needed any more,
   delete it.
 
For archive:   
   
Steps to build HWGUI interface module
     - Change to HWGUI directory "contrib/qrencode"
     - hbmk2 qrencode.hbp
     - Check, that the library for the HWGUI interface module
       "libqrcodegen.<ext> "is created in the HWGUI "lib" directory.
       <ext>: a, or lib or ? (depends of the used compiler)
