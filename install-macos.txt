1. Preface
----------

MacOS by Apple is not official supported by the Harbour project,
but the "xcode" development environment allows
to run Harbour and HWGUI applications on MacOS.
An extra set of make scripts are added to HWGUI, 
because a selection macro for the OS like "{linux}"
can not be set in *.hbp files for hbmk2 utility.
But you can negate the existing macros like
{!win}, details in the following chapters.

Some little modification in the HWGUI source code is done.

The MacOS kernel is derived from BSD, so LINUX scripts
and commands are running also here.


2. Installation steps
---------------------

Installation instructions, tested under 
MacOS Sonoma 14.5
Dual-Core Intel i3, 1.1GHz

For editing text files you need a suitable text editor,
the "TextEdit" coming with the system is only for some formats
(Rich-Text, HTML, ...)
For more info see chapter "2. Hints for programmers". 

    1.) Launch terminal:
        must be found in Applications/Utilities, 
        search for "Terminal":
        Finder, menu item "Go" (Gehe zu) and
        "Utilities" (Dienstprogramme), 
        key "command" + "U" 
        Start the Terminal and
        fix the Terminal at the dock, if running.
        (german: "Im Dock behalten")


    2.) Install the "xcode" development environment:
        xcode-select --install
        When extra window appeared, press the "Install" button
        in this extra window.
        Check the compiler by entering:
        gcc --version


    3.) Install Harbour from Source:
        - Download the newest code snapshot as ZIP 
        - Extract the Harbour archive,
          most done automatically.
        - become root user by
          sudo su 
          ==> Enter your password.
        - cd into base directory of Harbour
        - export HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
        - make install
        - leave root modus with "exit"
        - check:
          hbmk2 --version

       Path info:
       - All binaries are reachable by system PATH (/usr/local/bin)
       - Library path: /usr/local/lib/harbour
       - Include path: /usr/local/include/harbour


    4.) Install macports:

 
       Download package file for your OS, for example:
       MacPorts-2.9.3-14-Sonoma.pkg

      - become root with
        sudo su
      - installer -target / -pkg MacPorts-2.9.3-14-Sonoma.pkg
      - leave root by "exit"


  
    5.) Install GTK2    
    
       - sudo /opt/local/bin/port install gtk2

         Answer question "Continue? [Y/n]:" with "y"
         (after display of all dependency packages to be installed)
 
   
    6.) Install pkgconfig

        - sudo /opt/local/bin/port install pkgconfig   
   
        - Test flag display for GTK2:
         /opt/local/bin/pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0


    7.) Install XQuartz

        GTK2 supports only X11, so you need to install and
        start an X11 server:
        Download XQuartz from [6]
        for example XQuartz-2.8.5.pkg
        install by typing:
        sudo installer -target / -pkg XQuartz-2.8.5.pkg

        There must be started a background process.
        Test: 
        start "xeyes" or "xclock" in the terminal.
        Be shure, that the X icon is visible in the dock
        (after every login). A running process is marked
        with little point under the icon.
        Adding a "&" after the program call command,
        the program starts in background and you can enter
        more commands.
  

    7.) Compile HWGUI

        Installation destination is
        /Users/<userid>/hwgui/hwgui
        (at your home directory)
     
        - Create directory:
          mkdir hwgui
          and extract archive here.
        - rename hwgui-code-rnnnn... only to "hwgui"
        - set execute permission by
          chmod 755 make_macgtk2.sh
        - Start compilation by calling
          ./make_macgtk2.sh

  
    8.) Compile a sample program
     
        goto directory "samples"
        and start compiling of arraybrowse.prg
        hbmk2 arraybrowse.hbp
        Ignore warning:
        ld: warning: ignoring duplicate libraries: '-lhbrdd', '-lhbrtl', '-lhbvm'

        Start sample programm:
        ./arraybrowse
 

    9.) Compile your own application

        Use the file arraybrowse.hbp as a template
        to create a hbp file for building your own application.
        Because the HPB macro "{mac}" does not exist,
        use following macros to divide to your used operating system:
        - {!win} ==> for LINUX and MacOS
        - {!win&&!linux}   ==> only MacOS
        - {win} ==> Windows only 
        
        To divide code for MacOS for Harbour and HWGUI we suggest to use the following 
        define for all .prg files:
        ___MACOSX___
        So add the following line in your *.hbp file:
        {!linux&&!win}-d___MACOSX___
        So say in your .prg:
        #ifdef ___MACOSX___    
      
       Get more samples for programming your own HWGUI application
       in the subdirectory "samples" and at
       [3] Project "CLLOG". 
       
       If you also use Harbour Console/Terminal programs,
       solve a problem on MacOS:
       Regularly the command
       hbmk2 helloworld.prg
       compiles the program on Windows and LINUX and it runs at its best.
       Doing this on MacOS, the program is compiled
       successful, but runnung it with
         ./helloworld       the start is faulted with the following error message:
        dyld[1767]: Library not loaded: libharbour.dylib
        Referenced from: <F7B1FE28-9F46-3B03-BBF2-CCB7EC56B210> /Users/afumacbook/svnwork/
         hwgui/hwgui-code/hwgui/samples/helloworld        
         Reason: tried: 'libharbour.dylib' (no such file),
         '/System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes/OSlibharbour.dylib' (no such file),
         'libharbour.dylib' (no such file),
         '/Users/afumacbook/svnwork/hwgui/hwgui-code/hwgui/samples/libharbour.dylib' (no such file),
         '/System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes/OS/Users/afumacbook/svnwork/hwgui/hwgui-code/hwgui/samples/libharbour.dylib' (no such file),
         '/Users/afumacbook/svnwork/hwgui/hwgui-code/hwgui/samples/libharbour.dylib' (no such file)
          zsh: abort      ./helloworld
     Now compile this sample by
             ./hbmk.sh helloworld
      and it runs now.
      The script can also be used on LINUX, it
      has an OS autodetect function.          
            

2. Hints for programmers
------------------------

- Looking for a good editor to edit program code:
   Ask your preferred search engine entering: 
   "macos good text editor for programmers"  
   and you will get a lot of suggestions.
   I prefer "CotEditor", it is like "Notepad++"
   on Windows [4] and Open Source.
   But for Clipper/Harbour there is no syntax file
   available [5].
   
- Expand PATH
  Many of the new products are installed in another path.
  You can extend the path of the system as follows:
  - sudo bash 
    vim /etc/paths
  - Insert line at the end:
    /opt/local/bin
    To do this, turn on the append mode with "A",
    and press <ENTER> for a new line.
    After entering the new line 
    exit insert mode with the <ESC> key  
    and save by  
    wq!
  - Exit "root" mode with
    exit
  - Restart the computer for the change to take effect. 
 
- Installing the Subversion command line client
   sudo /opt/local/bin/port install subversion
   Actions analogous to "7.) Install XQuartz",
   but afterwards the "dbus-daemon" can 
   be deactivated, because it is not needed.
   Do this in "System settings" (Systemeinstellungen),
   "Common" (Allgemein), "Login items" (Anmeldeobjekte)
   Set 3 switches to "off".
   Check with
   svn --version
    whether the client starts.
    

- malloc.h is deprecated. 
  Now stdlib.h must be used instead
  (is not more part of ISO C99 standard).
 
  Inserted in  
   ==> source\gtk\inter.c
   ==> source\gtk\misc.c

  It depends of the Version of GCC,
  so set compiler switch -d__NOMALLOCH__,
  if needed.  
   
  #ifdef __NOMALLOCH__
  #include <stdlib.h>
  #else
  #include <malloc.h>
  #endif   

- This compiler define for C selects automatically code for MacOS
  #ifdef __APPLE__
   
- MacOS has no file like windows.h, so 
  windows_mac.h must be included instead.

  #ifdef __APPLE__
  #include "windows_mac.h"
  #else
  #include <windows.h>
  #endif  
 
  also for io.h: 
  #ifdef __APPLE__
          #include <sys/uio.h>
          #include <unistd.h>
  #else
          #include <io.h>
  #endif 
 
- Detection of operating system:
  the command uname and the Harbour function
  OS() returns on MacOS the value
    "Darwin".
