    PICTURE clause is added to GET commands - and it works as in Clipper.
    Editing of GET items became more close to Clipper's ( handling of Insert
    key, ReadExit() using ).

    It is not necessary now to designate in GET command ( and in other
    control definition commands ) the parent window and Control's ID - so
    commands became simpler and more close to Clipper's.

    New clause is added to DIALOG definition - 'CLIPPER'. If DIALOG is defined
    with this clause, you can move between GET's with ENTER key.

[+] HBrowse: added possibility to display bitmaps in columns.
    You can now define a codeblock for keys handling:
         
        oBrw:bKeyDown := {|oBrw,key|MyFunction(oBrw,key)}

    Look at the sample a.prg, function OpenAbout().

[+] Added new function which calls the standard dialog to choose color:
    Hwg_ChooseColor().

[+] Starting implementation of HGraph class - look at the sample graph.prg.

[+] Starting implementation of a new HwGUI application - forms designer,
    look at samples/designer.

[!] Few bugs fixed.
