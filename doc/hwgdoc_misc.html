   <br><strong class="subhead"><a name="Util1" href="hwgdoc.html#_Util1">
   7.1.  Designer</a></strong>
   <p> The Designer is intended to create/modify input screen forms and reports.
   It's main features are:</p>
     <ul>
        <li> The controls set is fully configurable. The list of
    controls ( widgets ) is placed in a special configuration XML file.
    The name of that file is specified in Designer's ini file
    "Designer.iml", currently it is resource/widgets.xml. To add a new
    control or even a controls set, or add new properties/methods for a
    control is easy now - just edit the widgets.xml. This allows to use
    the Designer not only for HwGUI based, but for any other
    applications - you can create a fully new controls set for your
    purposes. Report items, for example, has been added with an additional resource file -
    resource/repwidg.xml.
        <li>The Designer can be built not only as standalone program, but
    can be a part of other application where it is needed to edit forms
    and/or reports at runtime. There is a bat file bldlib.bat, which builds the
    designer.lib to link it in your application. To invoke the designer, you just need
    to call the function Designer():  
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Designer() - call Designer to open/create/edit any form ; 
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Designer( "-r" ) - call Designer to open/create/edit any report ; 
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Designer( "-s" ) - call Designer to create a new form ( doesn't allow to open any other ) ; 
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Designer( "-s",cForm ) - call Designer to edit a form 'cForm' ( doesn't allow to open any other ),
    the 'cForm' may be a file name or a string, containing the form ; 
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Designer( "-r","-s" ) - call Designer to create a new report ( doesn't allow to open any other ) ; 
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Designer( "-r","-s",cReport ) - call Designer to edit a report 'cReport' ( doesn't allow to open any other ),
    the 'cReport' may be a file name or a string, containing the report ;  
        <li>The output formats are configurable via the external
    scripts. The native HwGUI format support is included in Designer's
    code, all others are included as plugins. 
    Currently there are three plugins - for reading old .frm files (
    resource/f_text.prg ), for reading old .rpt files (
    resource/r_text.prg ) and for writing the prgs - f_hwgprg.prg ( not
    fully functional yet ).
        <li>Designer allows to set not only properties, but methods, too,
    - for every control / report item, so the resulting form description is a 
    complete dialog procedure, and the resulting report description is a complete report program,
    which opens/navigates/closes databases, calculates summs, etc.
        <li>HwGUI includes special classes to load / execute a form or report, created
    with the Designer - HFormTmpl, HRepTmpl.  
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp oForm := HFormTmpl():Read( cForm ) - loads a form,
    'cForm' may be a file name or a string, containing the form ; 
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp oForm:Show() - executes the loaded form, shows it on the screen ; 
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp oReport := HRepTmpl():Read( cReport ) - loads a report,
    'cReport' may be a file name or a string, containing the report ; 
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp oReport:Print( cPrinterName,lPreview ) - prints the report.  
     </ul>

   <p>Few notes for HwGUI applications about using of some properties and methods:
   </p>
     <ul>
       <li>There is a method 'common' in a form methods list, it is intended for
    functions, which are needed for the form and which can be called from
    any other event handler of the form. 
    Each function must be ended with the 'ENDFUNC' statement. The 'Return'
    isn't obligatory, but may be used if the function must return some
    value.
       <li>The form has a property 'Variables' - it is an array of variables,
    which will be declared as 'Private' in the beginning of HFormTmpl():Show()
    and may be used in any event handler of the form.
       <li>Each widget has a property 'Name' - this is a object name, which
    also will be declared as 'Private' in the beginning of HFormTmpl():Show().
       <li>The widgets, which have corresponding 'GET' items, has a property
    'Varname' - the name of the correspondibg variable, which also will
    be declared as 'Private' in the beginning of HFormTmpl():Show().
     </ul>

   <p>Few notes about the reports builder. 
   For a few years there was another report designer in HwGUI - HwReport.
   Now the Designer becomes the main report builder utility. It has more modern and advanced engine than
    Hwreport and, what is important, it is more easy to support one
    engine than two different :). The important point is that now the
    report builder may be integrated into the application and it is
    convenient, IMO, that the same code, the same module, linked into the
    application, implements two tasks - works with input forms and with
    reports. 
    The compatibility with the *.rpt files, created with Hwreport, is
    implemented via the plugin ( resource/r_text.prg ) - you may open rpt
    files, choosing the 'plain text format' and then save them in a new
    format, which is exactly the same as for input forms. 
    The new report engine uses a bit different approach than the old one.
    There are no 'markers' - the widget 'area' is used instead.
    You can convert any rpt file into the new
    format and you will see how these 'areas' are used. The 'area' has
    two main properties:
     <ul>
       <li>AreaType - it may be Table, DocHeader, DocFooter, PageHeader,
                 PageFooter. The Table is the same as the space between
                 'Start line' and 'End line' markers in the old engine.
       <li>VarOffset - False/True, it determines, if the area position on the
                  paper is fixed ( False ), or it depends on the size of
                  previous area ( True ).
     </ul>
    The areas may be nested - to implement subtables, for example. 
    The report itself has two methods:
     <ul>
       <li>onRepInit, which is executed when the report starts ;
       <li>onRepExit.
     </ul> 
    Every print item ( Label, Box, Vline, HLine, Bitmap ) has three
    methods:
     <ul> 
       <li>onBegin  - it is executed before the item is being printed ;
       <li>Condition - it must return a logical value ( with the 'Return'
                   statement ), which determines, should this item be
                   printed or no ;
       <li>onExit  - it is executed after the item is being printed.
     </ul> 
    The 'Label' item has additionally a method 'Expression', which
    calculates a string, which should be printed. 
    The 'area' has additionally a method 'onNextLine', which is executed
    for the each line in a 'Table' area - it is the same as script for
    the 'End Line' marker in an old report engine.

   7.6.  Binary container manager</a></strong>
   <p>
    The "binary container" is a feature to avoid<br>
    lot's of small binary files in the installation directory<br>
    of your HWGUI application.<br>
    Only one container file is needed to collect them all.<br>
    This could be image files (*.ico, *.bmp, *.jpg, ...)<br>
    and other special binary files.<br>
    It is the best solution for multi platform applications,<br>
    for example to avoid the usage of the Windows resource<br>
    compiler.<br>
    The default file extension for binary container is *.bin.<br>
    <br>
    The utility "Binary container manager" is for creating and editing
    binary container and is placed<br>
    with source code and build scripts in directory "utils/bincnt".<br>

   <br><strong class="subhead"><a name="Qhtm1" href="hwgdoc.html#_Qhtm1">
   8.2.1.  Overview</a></strong>
   <p>QHTM is a C++ library, which allows
    to display and print HTML content in your application  - on any window, 
    device context, on a report, on a button or in a tooltip. For more details look at
    <a href="http://www.gipsysoft.com/"> http://www.gipsysoft.com</a>. 
    HwGUI provides an interface for this library. To use it, you need to download
    QHTM from the <a href="http://www.gipsysoft.com/qhtm/freedownload.shtml">
     http://www.gipsysoft.com/qhtm/freedownload.shtml </a> and copy qhtm.dll to the same
     directory, where your application is.<br>
     <font color="FF0000" size+=1><b>Attention !!!</b></font> QHTM is released under other license
     than Harbour and HwGUI, so don't forget to read it before using !
   </p>

   	 [ ON SUBMIT &lt;bSubmit&gt; ] 
   	 [ STYLE &lt;nStyle&gt; ]
   </pre>
   <p>
   This command creates QHTM control. Html content may be assigned in three ways:
   <ul>
   <li> You can write it after CAPTION clause.
   <li> It may be in external html file, which name is designated after FILE clause.
   <li> Resource file. In this case appropriate resource name is signed after RESOURCE clause.
   </ul>
   ON CLICK clause determines the codeblock, which will be executed when user clicks on
   an external link. 
   ON SUBMIT clause determines the codeblock, which will be executed when user submits
   form.
   </p>
   <pre class="code">
