1. Directories
--------------
 
activex:
 Source code for ActiveX control library "libhwg_activex".
 The usage of this library is not recommended, because
 ActiveX is out of support.
 Substituted by HTML5 and Java.
 Detailed description in text file "doc/activex.txt".
 (Windows only)


misc:
  Source code for library "libhwg_misc".
  Additional Functions for:
  - Convert arrays to string
  - Encryption/Decryption functions, using BlowFish algorithm
  - Misc functions:
     ADDMETHOD()
     ADDPROPERTY()
     REMOVEPROPERTY()
     hwg_SetAll()
  - System for generating simple RTF files
  - Functions for "Say Money":
      English   :  SayDollar(nDollar)
      Indonesia :  SayRupiah(nRupiah)
    (It seems, that the function SayDollar() could be also used for
     other currencies like Euro's or british pounds sterling).  
  No detailed description available.
  
 
qhtm:
 Source code for library "libhwg_qhtm".
 Is an interface library for QHTM from GipsySoft.
 For details read HWGUI document:
 doc/hwgdoc_misc.htm, "8.2. Qhtm integration".
 (Windows only)

 
ext_controls:
  Source code for library "libhwg_extctrl".
  Extended class implementations:
  - "HBrowseEx"
  - "HComboBoxEx"
  - "HStaticEx"
  - "HButtonX"
  - "HButtonEX"
  - "HGroupEx"
  - "HStatusEx"
  - "HGridEX"
  - "HContainerEx"
  No detailed description available.
  (The feature "HComboBoxEx" is Windows only
   and is not part of the LINUX library)

  
hwmake:
 Utility to create build files for Borland C (BCC55)
 Build scripts:
   bld.bat  
 Build program with:
   bld.bat hwmake
 (Windows and Borland C Compiler only)


Project "HwMake"

HWMake is a tool to build for HwGUI and Harbour applications or libs. 

This tool was originally created from HwMake which came with HwGui,
but was then only available for Windows.
It was rewritten to work under Linux and has been greatly improved,
in order to manage as many operations as possible to complete the
creation and maintenance of applications or libs written
in harbour/hwgui.

You find this project at:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/hwmake/
 
  


hwreport:
 Visual Report Builder by Alexander S. Kresin.
 Create report forms for following using in
 HWGUI applications. It a substitute for
 the report functions of Clipper (RL.EXE).
 
 For build and usage instructions see file
 "contrib\hwreport\hwreport.txt".

 The usage together with the WinPrn class
 will be checked as soon as possible
 for validation with modern computers without
 (outdated) parallel printer interface
 and platforms Windows and Linux.

gthwg:
 GT library, based on HwGUI.
 
qrdecode:

 Scan and decode QR and EAN bar codes with a camera.
 The Processing in a HWGUI programm is done by external call of
 Zbar code reader.
 Details in ReadMe.txt file in this directory.
 ZBar is licensed under the GNU LGPL 2.1 to enable development of both open source and commercial projects.


2. Build scripts
----------------

build.sh:
 Build script for LINUX, uses makefile.linux
 
 makemngw.bat    GCC(MinGW)
 make_b32.bat    Borland C
 make_pc.bat     Pelles C Compiler
 make_vc.bat     Microsoft Visual C
 make_w32.bat    Open-Watcom

 
Harbour make files: 
 hbactivex.hbp
 hwg_extctrl.hbp
 hwg_qhtm.hbp
 gthwg.hbp

 
Other makefiles:
 makefile.bc     Borland C
 makefile.gcc    GCC(MinGW)
 makefile.pc     Pelles C Compiler
 makefile.vc     Microsoft Visual C
 makefile.wc     Open-Watcom



2.1 Build instructions
----------------------

Prerequisite is the successful build of Harbour and HWGUI
(or working binary installations).

Only these 4 libraries added in the "lib" directory:
 libhwg_extctrl.a
 libhwg_misc.a
 libhwg_qhtm.a
 libgthwg.a
 (file extension depends of the used compiler , e.g. ".lib")


LINUX:
______

Only "libhwg_misc" can be build.

makefile.linux: configure path to Harbour installation:

# Modify path to Harbour to your own needs 
# HRB_DIR = $(HB_PATH)
HRB_DIR = $(HOME)/Harbour/core-master

HRB_EXE = $(HRB_DIR)/bin/linux/gcc/harbour


Then start build process:
chmod 755
./build.sh



Windows:
________

See special instructions for your C Compiler in directory
  samples\dev
and sub directories (for example valid environment settings).

Start the batch file for your compiler.
